The film begins in ancient Egypt, where En Sabah Nur is betrayed by his followers and buried alive. He awakens in 1983 and finds the world changed by modern technology and human civilization. He decides to recruit four new Horsemen - Storm, Psylocke, Angel and Magneto - to help him cleanse the world of the weak and create a new one where only the strong survive.
 
Meanwhile, Professor Charles Xavier runs his school for young mutants, where he welcomes new students like Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Kurt Wagner. He also reconnects with his old friend Moira MacTaggert, who has been investigating the cult of En Sabah Nur. Xavier learns that En Sabah Nur is the first and most powerful mutant, and that he poses a great threat to humanity and mutantkind alike.
 
En Sabah Nur and his Horsemen launch a series of attacks around the world, destroying nuclear weapons, causing chaos and spreading fear. They also kidnap Xavier from his school, intending to use his telepathic powers to control all minds on Earth. Xavier's students, led by Mystique and Beast, team up with Quicksilver, who reveals that he is Magneto's son, and Wolverine, who escapes from a secret facility where he was experimented on. They manage to rescue Xavier from En Sabah Nur's pyramid in Cairo, where the final showdown takes place.
 
Xavier and his students face off against En Sabah Nur and his Horsemen, who have unleashed their full powers. Magneto has a change of heart after seeing his old friends and his son fighting for him, and he joins them against En Sabah Nur. Storm also switches sides after realizing that En Sabah Nur is not a god but a tyrant. Together, they manage to weaken En Sabah Nur enough for Jean to unleash her Phoenix Force and destroy him once and for all.
 
The film ends with Xavier restoring his school and offering to train his students to become the next generation of X-Men. He also erases Moira's memories of him again, as he did in X-Men: First Class, to protect her from his enemies. Magneto and Mystique leave to find their own paths, while Quicksilver decides not to tell Magneto that he is his son. The film also hints at the future appearance of Mr. Sinister, a villain who has an interest in Wolverine's DNA.
